# Project 2
## Description
Your goals:
- Come up with **questions** about your data: What trends exist? Does that contradict what we'd expect? What are some key takeaways we can pull from the data?
- **Explore** your data! Try statistics and numerical insights, and build visualizations that describe the trends you see
- **Document** your code! Use comments, markdown cells, anything to make a self-supported analysis of the data and the outcome

## Deliverable
- Visualizations, numerical tables – whatever you need to answer the questions you laid out in the project scope
- A Colab notebook ready-to-go with annotations in markdown cells or comments
  - An HTML file would be ideal, either use [this janky link]() or slack your PC to have them convert it for you.
- Use of GitHub is *encouraged*, but not required!
- Slack Ishaan the deliverable before next workshop!
