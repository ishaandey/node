# Project Part III: Investor Day

Here's where we started our journey, two and a half months ago: 

> Imagine you've been hired at a top tier quantitative think tank – HackyForge. They are a new group that tackles contemporary issues from an analytical angle. Sometimes there are clients, but oftentimes the team publishes with the intention of releasing their findings into the public domain.

After 10 weeks, you've got an incredible work product: visualizations and quantitative explorations of the data from Part II, and now predictive models investigating your questions of interest. Your directors at HackyForge want you to present these findings to a panel of potential investors, who are all interested in the projects that HackyForge generates. The **best project will recieve "funding" from investors** (last year was a $150 gift card) and have their work put on showcase (on our Forge-wide site).

## Analysis

After conducting the exploration in part II, your goal is now to now use machine learning techniques to help answer questions. Make sure to select the correct algorithm to answer your research question, run diagnostics and accuracy scores to gauge performance. 

## Deliverable

Your final readout will comprise of two parts: (1) a slide deck highlighting your data, approach, & major findings, and (2) your code and all documentation from the project. Details below:

- Prepare for a short presentation, 5 minutes on a slide deck, and another 5 minutes for audience Q&A.
- The deck should contain the following sections:
  1. **Objectives**: What did you set out to learn? What research questions guided your analysis?
  2. **Dataset**: Which data source(s) did you use? Use this space to give some context about the data (units of observations, time periods, subsets, etc.) 
  3. **Findings**: Use this space to highlight your most informative visualizations, quantitative summaries, and/or predictive models. Make sure to mention your approach for modelling and its accuracy, but no need to jump into the details (i.e. hyperparameter). 
  4. **Limitations & Future Analysis**: Briefly mention what your approach / data failed to answer, and what you'd be interested in exploring as a next steps.
 - Keep this at a high level! While you may have used incredibly complex algorithmns for your analysis, your goal as an analyst is to break this down for a non-technical investor. Toss in the technical comments into an appendix if needed. 
- With regards to formatting, make sure to keep it simple. Use the deck as a primary place to show high-level questions, insights, and scaffolding for figures. 

### Submission
- Use the following checklist to ensure all materials are in your folder:
  1. **Slide deck**, following the guidelines from above. 
  2. `.pdf` **scoping document** from Part I
  3. `.ipynb` notebook containing your data **exploration** from Part II
  4. `.ipynb`notebook containing your **model** from Part III (doesn't need to be annotated)
- These are due to Ishaan via **Slack by 2pm on Sunday, April 28th**. Make sure to mention (a) all team member names, and (b) the project title. 
- Make sure your **viewing permissions are set to anyone with a a link**. You can double check this by opening the link from an incognito window. 


Any questions, issues, or advice – Slack your instructor, and they'll be more than happy to help out. Best of luck.
