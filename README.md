# Node
![](tools/assets/forge-coral-banner.png)

Welcome! Node is a ten-week introductory data science course offered by [Forge (formerly HackCville)](https://joinforge.co/), where you'll pick up **core data literacy skills** and apply them in domains of interest.

Among other things, we'll learn the foundations of *data manipulation*, *exploratory data analysis*, *machine learning*, and apply them towards our own areas of interests in projects. Though the course assumes some basic knowledge of programming or familiarity with Python, all are welcome.

By the end of this course, our goal is to show what's possible by learning data science – how to ask the right questions, critique models, and cut through the noise to help you find the patterns in your work. Ultimately, we'd like you to leave with enough familiarity of Python to be independent analysts in your own fields, as well as understand how data science is increasingly used in the world around us.

## Course Details 
All weeks will comprise of (1) a lesson delivered through **workshops**, typically as a Jupyter Notebook, (2) supplemental practice to be completed during **labs**, (3) cumulative **projects** that apply data skills to real-world problems. 

### Course Materials
All course material (slides, notebooks, datasets, etc.) will live in the [Node GitHub repository](https://github.com/ishaandey/node). For ease of access, we've setup a mirror at [files.node.ishaandey.com](https://files.node.ishaandey.com/) that'll allow for downloading individual files.
