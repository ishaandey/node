# Node Fall 2020

Node is a 10-week data science course offered by [HackCville](https://hackcville.com/), where students will learn core data literacy skills, including data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and a high-level introduction to machine learning. 

This course is designed for students with some programming or data science experience, particularly Python, but is open to all students. 

## Course Details 
All weeks will comprise of (1) a lesson delivered through workshops, most often as a Jupyter Notebook, (2) supplemental content to be completed during labs, (3) links for further exploration or example applications, and (4) a relevant XKCD or Calvin & Hobbes comic. 

### Course Materials
- All course material (slides, Python notebooks, datasets, etc.) will live in this GitHub repository
- For ease of access, we've setup a mirror at [files.node.ishaandey.com](https://files.node.ishaandey.com/) that'll allow you to individually download files to your local computer
